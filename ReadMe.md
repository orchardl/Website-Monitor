These two scripts do the same thing, just one in PowerShell and one with Python. I've used windows task scheduler in the past, but it was on a jump box. Now that I tried using it on my main machine, I didn't like it as much, so I decided to put it in a docker container and schedule it from there. Once in the docker container, chatgpt helped me rewrite the script to python (crazy how it does that so well).
